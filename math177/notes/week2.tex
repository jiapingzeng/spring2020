\begin{itemize}
	\item Annuity: a series of payments to be made at defined times in the future
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Annuity-certain: payments are not contingent on a future event
		      \item We assume annuity-certain unless specified otherwise
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Annuity-immediate: a series of payments for which the following conditions are met
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item [1.] the interest rate is constant at $i$ per payment period (\textit{frequency})
		      \item [2.] the payments are of equal amount (\textit{term of the annuity}: nthe number of payments)
		      \item [3.] the payments are made at the end of each payment period
		      \item [4.] either one of:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item the AV is valued at the time of (and including) the final payment: \[s_{\angl{n}i}:=\sum_{t=0}^{n-1}(1+i)^t=\frac{(1+i)^n-1}{i}\]
			            \item the PV is valued one period before the first payment: \[a_{\angl{n}i}:=\sum_{t=1}^{n}v^t=\frac{1-v^n}{i}\]
		            \end{itemize}
		      \item Note: $s_{\angl{n}i}=(1+i)^na_{\angl{n}i}$ and $a_{\angl{n}i}=v^ns_{\angl{n}i}$
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Annuity-due: same as annuity-immedaite in the first three conditions, with modified condition 4:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item [4.] either one of:
		            \begin{itemize}
			            \item the AV is valued one period after the final payment
			            \item the PV is valued at the time of the first payment
		            \end{itemize}
	      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
